# BrainFuck-Interpreter
A simple BrainFuck Interpreter in Java.

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.
The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.

# Commands

The eight language commands each consist of a single character:

Character	Meaning

1. The >	increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).
2. <	decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).
3. '+'	increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.
4. '-'	decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.
5. .	output the byte at the data pointer.
6. ,	accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.
7. [	if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.
8. ]	if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command.
9. (Alternatively, the ] command may instead be translated as an unconditional jump to the corresponding [ command, or vice versa; programs will behave the same but will run more slowly, due to unnecessary double searching.)
10. [ and ] match as parentheses usually do: each [ matches exactly one ] and vice versa, the [ comes first, and there can be no unmatched [ or ] between the two.
